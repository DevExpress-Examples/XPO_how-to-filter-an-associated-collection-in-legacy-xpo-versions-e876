# How to filter an associated collection in legacy XPO versions


<p>This example demonstrates how to define a filtered collection property in a persistent class (for legacy XPO versions). Beginning with the v2011 vol2 release, you do not need the code demonstrated here as you can simply assign the required criteria to the XPCollection.Criteria property. To run the example, you need a Northwind database on a local SQL Server. Refer to the <a href="https://www.devexpress.com/Support/Center/p/A2349">A2349</a> article for additional information.</p>
